Project: Password Complexity Checker using Python

This project involves building a password complexity checker that evaluates the strength of a given password based on predefined criteria. The tool will assess various characteristics of the password to ensure it meets security best practices, such as length, inclusion of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and the absence of common words.

Key Features:

1. Length Check: Ensures the password is within an acceptable length range (e.g., 8-16 characters).


2. Character Diversity: Verifies that the password includes a mix of:

Uppercase letters (A-Z)

Lowercase letters (a-z)

Numbers (0-9)

Special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, %, ^)



3. Common Word Detection: Flags passwords that contain common words or predictable sequences.


4. Strength Score: Assigns a strength score (e.g., weak, moderate, strong) based on the complexity of the password.


5. Feedback Messages: Provides user-friendly feedback on how to improve the password (e.g., "Include at least one special character").



Technologies Used:

Python for the core logic and processing.

Regular expressions (regex) to perform pattern matching for the
